# dash-databricks
Build Real-Time Production Data Apps with Databricks &amp; Plotly Dash. We used the Databricks SQL connector for Python (DB SQL) within a Plotly Dash app to run queries on Databricks SQL endpoints, demonstrating the efficacy of this method for managing data-warehousing style workloads with high concurrency and low latency SLAs.
